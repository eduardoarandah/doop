/* Server-side PostHog capture — for events that happen where posthog-js
 * can't see them (MCP agents, background work). Events use the user's id
 * as distinct_id, the same id the web client identifies with, so they land
 * on the same PostHog person as the browser events.
 *
 * The key is the same public project token the client bundle ships with;
 * VITE_POSTHOG_KEY is a Railway service variable, so it is present at
 * runtime too, not only as a build arg. No key → captures are no-ops
 * (local dev, self-hosted installs with analytics off). */
